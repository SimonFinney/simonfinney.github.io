title: Gaining Empathy
description: #
---

For this post, I spent some time dissecting the current state of gig listing, by
identifying some issues in what's already available. I also had a look at
creating a rough persona for the project, as a means of quickly building empathy
with our user, and developing a likely scenario in which they might use the
product.

## Pain points

Trying to proactively figure out what's on in the city every week is extremely
time consuming, and if you're not constantly at it, things can almost always
slip under the radar.

Below are some samples from [MCD.ie](http://www.mcd.ie/listings/) and
[Tickets.ie](http://www.tickets.ie/events.aspx/category/Music/1), highlighting
some of the issues that plague gig listing websites today:

MCD.ie makes it pretty difficult to discover upcoming gigs:

- Everything is in-your-face — it's a classic case of information overload
- Flexible filtering options are nowhere to be seen

Tickets.ie, while slightly better than MCD, still lacks in many regards:

- Filtering can only occur one genre at a time — good luck to anyone trying to
  filter by date or their location productively!
- There's no way to focus on what I'm interested in or what's happening near me
- How do I stop missing out on gigs that I really want to attend?

With the above pain points in mind, I took a first pass at developing a
proto-persona that captures the needs of what I believe is a typical user.

## Meet Eoin

[Eoin](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNNlhldnFENlJOUmc) is an
ideal representation for the issues outlined above — he represents someone who
could use the product both casually and on-the-spot, when he's looking for
something to do.

The artifacts were generated over a period of an hour using an
[empathy mapping](https://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/empathy-map.pdf)
exercise, as a means of quickly placing myself in my user's shoes to understand
their pains and opportunities. From here, I borrowed some formatting guidelines
(Gothelf & Seiden, 2013), such as demographic information, and goals and pain
points to develop a best guess as to who exactly is using these products and
why.

Once I had an idea of who Eoin is, I began brainstorming how his typical
scenario and narrative may be, via experience mapping and storyboarding.

## Experience mapping and storyboarding

Using the empathy map and persona, I produced a basic experience map that would
outline the scenario of Eoin attempting to discover a gig for the weekend.

Mapping out the experience helped me understand the possible settings in which
the current applications are used (Cooper, Cronin, & Reimann, 2007).

From here I used storyboarding as a means of understanding the current scenario
better. Storyboarding would help communicate opportunities and pain points by
telling a user-centric story, as well as provide a narrative I could use when
producing screencasts.

The final scenario and storyboard ended up as the following:

1. Eoin's boarding a bus on his way home from work on a Friday evening and he's
   hoping to do something one night over the weekend
2. Once he manages to get a seat, he takes his phone out and begins looking for
   gigs on tonight
3. He opens up a number of different things - social networks to see if his
   friends are attending anything, and ticketing website he frequently accesses
   to get a complete picture of what may be going on
4. When he's looking through the websites, he has to navigate through each of
   the categories one-by-one, wishing there was a more efficient way of doing
   this
5. With so much happening across the country, he's only really interested in
   what's happening in his current city or what's near him, and he only cares
   about bands he's interested in
6. When he does eventually find something he might be interested in, he
   discovers it's sold out! He's annoyed he didn't find out about that sooner,
   otherwise he definitely would've went
7. He painstakingly continues his search until he discovers something he might
   enjoy

## Next steps

With a groundwork seeded in empathy, and a draft visual tone finally in place, I
can move forward with restructuring the product's information architecture to
improve the current experience.
