To kick this project off, I knew from the top of my head that there were a
number of things that had to put in place:

- The idea or need that would be the design's focus
- The platform I'd use to document my work
- The tools and processes I'd use to manage my time

This post will focus on where I landed on the above topics, and touch on how
I'll move forward from here.

## Area of focus

When deciding on what I should set my sights on, I knew vaguely that I wanted to
concentrate on designing something that I was interested in and passionate
about, and to also address a need that could impact my life for the better in
some way or another.

As a music lover, I try to attend as many gigs around the city as I can in my
free time, but have a hard time keeping tracking of what's on tonight and where,
what's coming up soon, and what's coming into town in the future.

Unfortunately, there's no single point of truth for me when it comes to
discovering gigs that may be on the horizon, and I find that I have to use a
combination of a number of different websites
([entertainment.ie](http://entertainment.ie/music/listings/),
[NME](http://www.nme.com/tickets/city/dublin), and
[Tickets.ie](http://www.tickets.ie/) to name just a few), social networks, along
with word-of-mouth to get the job done and find the information I need.

Here's some samples outlining the lack of customisability, flexibility and
variety of information my current means provide:

As a result of this issue, I've decided to examine some of the ways I currently
employ when searching for gigs to attend, and design a solution in the form of a
high-fidelity interactive prototype, by applying knowledge from a wide variety
of areas, including:

- Psychology, in particular the cognitive, emotional, perceptual, and social
  aspects of it
- Content strategy and information architecture
- Accessibility and inclusive design

As well as looking at the above areas, throughout the course of the next month,
I'll conduct the following tasks in an effort to improve the overall gig-finding
experience:

- Develop proto-personas and scenarios
- Research a number of design languages, and pattern libraries, integrating
  knowledge learned from this into the application
- Conduct usability testing to evaluate my designs in an iterative manner

## Blog platform and project management

After much deliberation on choosing a platform ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
[Medium](https://medium.com/), or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)), I
decided to use Jekyll and host it on GitHub Pages as, while the setup was more
complicated than the other platforms to get started, it provided me with greater
flexibility to customise the layout, handles higher levels of traffic, and also
provided the opportunity to open source the blog's code on GitHub for anyone to
fork and contribute to.

Overviewing a few project management tools to use ([Asana](https://asana.com/),
and [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)), I decided that
as I'll be working on my own, the use of these would be overkill. As a result,
I've created a project plan which can be accessed
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cslYNdrI2uEUQJJxMyQ1FbJkkaDBW0eMrTyV0VlHwAM/edit?usp=sharing).
This outlines both the research and tasks I intend on conducting over the course
of the next month, along with some provisional dates in place to ensure I remain
on track.

## Next steps

In the next post, I'll discuss some of the design languages, and pattern
libraries I'll be researching, as well as the prototype and visual design
platforms I intend on using.
